# Project Update 1

##Software Plan:
We plan to construct our software form scratch to ensure we properly understand how it works and can tweak it wherever. 
Once we have developed something sufficient, we will compare the performance of our software against a pre-existing COVID fake news classifier.

##Datasets in Consideration:
*[COVID-19 Fake News Dataset 1](More Comprehensive)] (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/covid19-fake-news)
*[COVID-19 Fake News Dataset 2] (https://www.kaggle.com/thesumitbanik/covid-fake-news-dataset)
