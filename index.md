# Trained for Trust: Detecting Misinformation in Journalism and Social Media Regarding COVID-19

## Project Description
In the year 2020, misinformation seemed to spread as quickly as the virus that had defined it. Established facts devolved into hotly debated topics and low-brow journalism had presided over the advice of experts and scientific research. Consequently, the United States is largely fragmented in their opinions toward the severity of COVID (in turn contributing to its spread) and thousands have become disillusioned with modern journalism, uncertain as to what to believe on the internet.

This project aims to effectively address this misinformation crisis through ***the restoration of trust*** in journalism and the identification of false information on the internet. Using a classifier trained on recent and comprehensive datasets, the goal is to flag articles, specifically those shared on platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, that either intentionally or unintentionally include untrue statements regarding COVID or COVID-related topics. To ensure accessibility, it is my hope that the end product can be accessed via a web extension and can progressively improve through continual learning.

## Tentative Goals:
- Create supervised ML classifier that can identify misinformation campaigns/articles on social media platforms. Emphasis false articles regarding COVID-19
- Deploy classifier as a Chrome web extension
- Employ "citizen science" (manual identification of fake news) in the design of the algorithm
