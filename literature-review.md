## Literature Review

1. FNDNet â€“ A deep convolutional neural network for fake news detection.

    In a recent experimental project similar to our own, Kaliyar et al. test the efficacy of a deep convolutional neural network designed to automatically learn the discriminatory features for fake news classification. They benchmark their model using comprehensive datasets and consider various perfomance evaluative parameters such as Wilcoxon, false positive, and true negative to validate their results. Much to our amazement, the research group reports that their model acheived 98.36% accuracy in fake news detection.

2. Fake News Classification of Social Media Through Sentiment Analysis

    In this paper, Sinott et al. test the hypothesis that fake news on social media typically deals with emotive topics and that a neural network equipped with sentiment classification will, therefore, perform well in fake news detection. In doing so, they train their models using Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and bi-LSTM for sentiment classification and feature selection. News from *FakeNewsNet* and *CredBank* are employed for the algorithm's development. Their final results demonstrate that sentiment analyses can help improve the discrimination of fake news from real news.
