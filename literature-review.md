## Literature Review

1. FNDNet â€“ A deep convolutional neural network for fake news detection.

    In a recent experimental project similar to our own, Kaliyar et al. test the efficacy of a deep convolutional neural network designed to automatically learn the discriminatory features for fake news classification. They benchmark their model using comprehensive datasets and consider various perfomance evaluative parameters such as Wilcoxon, false positive, and true negative to validate their results. Much to our amazement, the research group reports that their model acheived 98.36% accuracy in fake news detection.
