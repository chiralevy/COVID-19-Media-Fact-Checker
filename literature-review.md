## Literature Review
On this page, we list recent and credible pieces of literature that will help guide and substantiate this project. 

1. ## FNDNet – A deep convolutional neural network for fake news detection
⋅⋅⋅In a recent experimental project similar to our own, Kaliyar, PhD et al. test the efficacy of a deep convolutional neural network designed to automatically learn the discriminatory features for fake news classification. They benchmark their model using extensive training and test datasets, moreover consider variaous perfomance evaluative parameters such as Wilcoxon, false positive, and true negative. Much to our amazement, the research group reports that their model acheived 98.36% accuracy in fake news detection.
