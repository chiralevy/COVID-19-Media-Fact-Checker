Project Update 2: 
- Bullepoints of what we have tried so far. 
    - Looking at the datasets to familiarize ourselves with it 
    - Preprocess dataset
    - Shooting for an A!!! Grill us please :D 
    - Bare bones of the project, i.e. simple Neural Network without the more complicated hidden layers and such

Methods Outline:
- Good idea of how to complete the project:
    - We should understand and execute the outline of our NN
        - Adding the more complicated layers of our NN 
        - Rerunning the python script with the additional HL on the datasets

Discussion: 
- Start outlining the results of the experiment:
    - Not necessarily anything concrete but have a rough idea of how to critique/assess the experiments
    - Some things to gather:
        - Accuracy -- performance, etc. 
        - Bias of the algorithm/data set 
        - Complete a comparison of the performance on both data sets used
